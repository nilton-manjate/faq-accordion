          Frontend Mentor offers realistic coding challenges to help
          developers improve their frontend coding skills with
          projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's suitable for
          all levels and ideal for portfolio building.

          The majority of our challenges are free, yes.
          We do have some that are premium and require a
          Pro subscription to access. It will say on each
          challenge whether they are free or premium,
          so it's easy to tell the difference.

          Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you
          build in your portfolio. Helping developers add 
          professional-looking projects to their portfolio was
          one of the reasons we created this platform!

          The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge
          is in our Discord server. There are thousands of other
          developers in there, so it's a great place to ask
          questions. We even have a dedicated "help" channel!
          If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to
          our Discord server here.
